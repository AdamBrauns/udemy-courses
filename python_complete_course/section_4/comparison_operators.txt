Comparison Operators
In this lecture we will be learning about Comparison Operators in Python. These operators will allow us to compare variables and output a Boolean value (True or False).

If you have any sort of background in Math, these operators should be very straight forward.

First we'll present a table of the comparison operators and then work through some examples:

Table of Comparison Operators
In the table below, a=3 and b=4.

Operator	Description	Example
==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
!=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true
>	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
<	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
>=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
<=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.
